## Porblem Description:

as a fan of geometry, i want to model a line based on points consisting of x and y coordinates plane based on cartecian system. so that i can calculate its length.

## Dev Environment Setup:


## Pre-requisite :
- Have a Replit account
- have four input for the line coordinates (X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
- give the result to users.


## How to run test:
- for replit environment: <br>
open unit test icon (check icon) on the left side ->
click Run tests -> if test passed, it will turn to green.
- for IDE environment: <br>
after clone this project, make sure you move test/CalculatelengthTest.java file to correct package -> make sure you have JUNIT libary -> run the test -> if test passed, it will turn to green.

## Build Instruction: 

## Run Instruction: 
- for replit environment: <br>
open Main.java file -> make sure you are opening console tab on the right side -> click run button on top of the screen -> input 4 values for line coordinate (x1, y1, x2, y2) -> get the result.
- for IDE environment: <br>
clone this project to your local repository -> open Main.java file -> run the file from your IDE -> input 4 values for line coordinate (x1, y1, x2, y2) -> get the result.
