- for IDE environment: <br>
after clone this project, make sure you move test/CalculatelengthTest.java file to correct package -> make sure you have JUNIT libary -> run the test -> if test passed, it will turn to green.

## Build Instruction: 
- for replit environment: <br>
you don't need to build the project, just run the Main.java file

## Run Instruction: 
- for replit environment: <br>

- for IDE environment: <br>
clone this project to your local repository -> open Main.java file -> run the file from your IDE -> input 4 values for line coordinate (x1, y1, x2, y2) -> get the result.
